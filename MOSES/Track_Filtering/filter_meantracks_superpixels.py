Information
------------
This is a specialised track cleaning module for migrating epithelial sheets
currently it is framed for 2 coloured sheets, but one can easily adapt for phase contrast migrating sheets too.

1) applied superpixel clique cleaning
2) dynamic propagation with continuity enforcement to grab all the relevant tracks. 

N.B. assumes diametrically opposing epithelioid sheets.
